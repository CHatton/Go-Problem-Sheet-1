# Go Problem Sheets
Repository for Go problem assignments as part of 3rd year Software Development course.

In order to run the files, first clone the repository.

Navigate to the folder of the file you want to run.

Make sure that you have the [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)  installed.

You can run the program by either first building it.

```bash
> go build <file-name>
```

And then running the executable.
Or you can simply run the command

```bash
> go run <file-name>
```
