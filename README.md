# Go Problem Sheet 1
My name is Cian Hatton, I created this repository to hold my solutions to to this [problem sheet](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html).

This is problem sheet 1 for the Data Representation and Querying module in my 3rd year Software Development course at GMIT.

All solutions are written in the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language.

In order to run the files, first clone the repository.

Make sure that you have the [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)  installed.

Navigate to the folder of the file you want to run.

```bash
> cd problem-sheets
```

You can run the program by either first building it.

```bash
> go build <file-name>
```

And then running the executable.

```bash
> ./<file-name>
```

Or you can simply use the command

```bash
> go run <file-name>
```
